    - AgentWeapon field to see which weapon is equipped                                 done  
    - animating player movement                                                         done
    - animating weapon usage                                                            done
    - separating equipping weapon from using weapon                                     done

    - separating player inventories                                                     done     (inventories alreay separated, only pick up system had to be adjusted)                               
    - separating player healthbars (i guess)                                            done        "

    - player pickup sounds                                                              done    but not separated in order for others to get feedback if someone picked something up
                                                                                                

    think about next steps in the game:

    - attacking damages players


    - ui mousefollower position fixen


    - ingame menu
    - background music
